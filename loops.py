# A 'for'-loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string)

prophets = ['Adam','Nuh',"Ibrahim","Musa","Isa","Muhammed"]

# Simple for loop
# for prophet in prophets:
#     print(f'Prophet {prophet} a.s')
    
# # Break the loop
# for prophet in prophets:
#     if(prophet == 'Muhammed'):
#         break
#     print(f'Prophet {prophet} a.s was sent before prophet Muhammed a.s')
  
#   continue the loop(basically it skips that check)  
# for prophet in prophets:
#     if(prophet == 'Muhammed'):
#         continue
#     print(f'Prophet {prophet} a.s was sent before prophet Muhammed a.s')
